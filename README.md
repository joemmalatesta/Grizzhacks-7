# A Next port of the GrizzHacks website

### To run
- git clone [link]
- npm i
- npm run dev

### About
This site will be static and completely client side, meaning there should be no neccessity for server side functions.

### Contributing
- Do what you want but keep it in a branch to avoid merge conflicts
 - Try to keep each branch to a single feature and make a PR every time you fininsh it. 
- Keep each section in it's own component so we don't have a 10000 line file
- Performance is key. Make sure images and shit are not too big.
